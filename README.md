GNOME plugin to control Apple Studio Display brightness through the quick settings menu.  

## Installation
First, make sure you have Studi installed: https://github.com/himbeles/studi, as it's the backend that allows this project to work. This doesn't do any low-level control; it's just a front end for the Studi CLI that tries to look native for GNOME.  

You can then install this plugin by placing the ``Studi-Brightness-Control@matey-0`` folder in the following path: ``~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/Studi-Brightness-Control@matey-0``; you'll then need to toggle the plugin on, just run ``gnome-extensions enable Studi-Brightness-Control@matey-0`` in the terminal.
