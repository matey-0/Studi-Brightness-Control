# Studi-Brightness-Control
GNOME Plugin to control Apple Studio Display brightness through quick settings menu.

You can install this plugin by placing the ``Studi-Brightness-Control@matey-0`` folder in the following path: ``~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/Studi-Brightness-Control@matey-0``.  
You need to have this installed: https://github.com/himbeles/studi, as it's the backend that allows this project to work. This doesn't do any low level control, it's just a front end for the studi CLI that tries to look native.
